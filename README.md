# Spotify-cloneðŸŽµ
> My second big frontend project â€” a Spotify-inspired music player built using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. Unlike my first project, this isnâ€™t just a tutorial copy. I learned how to dynamically fetch songs, control playback, and create a responsive, interactive UI that feels like a mini music app.
